    <h4>RADWIMPS, The best japanese Band</h4>
    <p>So, Why are they this good for me? first of all let's talk about their way to play the songs. They have an
        unusual disposition, apart from the guitars, drums and bassist. They have a violinist and a pianist (not
        keyboarder). Width this disposition they do absolutley fantstic songs, infact they were called 2 times for doing
        film's soundtracks, and they are going to do another album for another film. Evcerytime i listen to them, i have
        an overfow of emotions with every song. Thanks to them i had more energuy while working, and i may be listening
        right now too!</p>
    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
        -->

    <!-- EXTRA:
         EXERCISE 9
            Create album details that are going to be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible)
        -->

    <!--
            EXERCISE 11
